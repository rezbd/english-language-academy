            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p><span className="fs-2 text-danger">E</span>nglish Language Academy has been developed in close cooperation with the British Language Centre - a leading Adult Language Education Centre with multiple facilities, and an official English Language Testing Centre for London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, TELC (The European Language Certificates), and by Pearson - the largest Educational company in the world (Financial Times Group).</p>

            <p>Claudia E. founded the Center in March of 2014. She brings specialized experience and coaching to students. On any given day, Kouloud (Claudia) Elsayed can find herself in front of a roomful of students from around the world. Each has a goal to learn to speak English. And each of them approaches it with a unique cultural background – and varying familiarity with the language.</p>

            <p>
                Claudia has learned to embrace the challenge that can present. “She takes care of the individual needs of all students even though [they are] all different,” says one of her students. While she carefully covers the basics of grammar and spelling, Claudia has a reputation for making learning comfortable and fun, using real-world conversation and storytelling as teaching tools.
